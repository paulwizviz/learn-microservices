# KYC Domain Analysis: A Report on Personas, Organisations, and Key Processes

This report outlines the foundational understanding of the Know Your Customer (KYC) domain, focusing on the essential processes, key personas, and involved organisations. It serves as a comprehensive outcome of our initial domain analysis, providing a structured overview to support subsequent design and implementation phases.

## What is KYC?

At its core, KYC is the essential due diligence process of verifying a client's identity and assessing the potential risks of doing business with them. The primary objective is to prevent a company, like Datum's clients, from being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, making it a cornerstone of modern regulatory compliance.

The KYC process is typically built on three core activities:

* **Customer Identification Programme (CIP)**: The initial step of verifying that customers are who they claim to be.

* **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)**: Assessing a customer's risk profile and understanding the purpose of the business relationship.

* **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuously scrutinising customer activity to detect suspicious behaviour and changes in risk.

## Scenario: Alex Opens a Digital Bank Account

Alex decides to open a new digital-only bank account. The process is entirely online, and the bank, following its KYC protocol, guides Alex through three distinct stages: the CIP, CDD, and Ongoing Monitoring.

**Step 1:** The Customer Identification Programme (CIP)

The first step is for the bank to verify Alex's identity. When Alex begins the online application, the bank's system asks for core identifying information: Full legal name, Date of birth, Residential address, and a government-issued identification number.

To verify this information, the system prompts Alex to upload a photo of a government-issued ID and to take a real-time selfie. The verification technology uses "liveness detection" to confirm that Alex is a real, living person and not a static image or a deepfake.

**Step 2:** Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

Once Alex's identity is verified, the bank moves on to assess their risk profile. This stage is based on a risk-based approach, ensuring the level of scrutiny is appropriate for the perceived risk. The bank's automated system performs a series of background checks, including screening against global watchlists, checking for adverse media, and checking for Politically Exposed Person (PEP) status.

In this case, Alex is a typical, low-risk customer, so the bank conducts Simplified Due Diligence (SDD). Had Alex been flagged as high-risk, the bank would have been required to conduct an Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) investigation.

**Step 3:** Ongoing Monitoring

After the account is opened, the KYC process becomes a continuous obligation. The bank's system continuously monitors Alex's account and transaction activity to detect any changes in their risk profile or suspicious behaviour, such as large international transfers to a high-risk jurisdiction.

## Scenario: A Technology Startup, 'Innovate Inc.', Opens a Corporate Account

The founders of Innovate Inc. need to open a corporate bank account. To do so, the bank must conduct a thorough KYC process that includes the CIP, CDD, and Ongoing Monitoring.

**Step 1:** The Corporate Identification Programme (CIP)

The first step is to establish that Innovate Inc. is a real, legally-formed entity. The bank must also verify its key personnel. The bank requires documents such as articles of incorporation, proof of address, and identification for all authorised signatories. A critical step is identifying the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs)—the natural persons who ultimately own or control the company.

**Step 2:** Corporate Due Diligence (CDD)

After verifying the company's basic information, the bank's compliance team conducts a deeper risk assessment. The bank screens the company and its key individuals (including UBOs and directors) against global watchlists and adverse media databases. Based on its findings, the bank assigns Innovate Inc. a risk rating. As a new technology startup with no prior suspicious activity, it is assessed as low-risk and undergoes Standard Due Diligence.

**Step 3:** Corporate Ongoing Monitoring

Once the corporate account is active, a similar process of ongoing monitoring applies. The bank continuously monitors the account's transaction patterns to detect any suspicious activity, such as large wire transfers to a high-risk country unrelated to its declared business.
